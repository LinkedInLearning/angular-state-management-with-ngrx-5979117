## Course Description

_See the readme file in the main branch for updated instructions and information._
## Instructions
This repository has folders for each of the videos in the course. 

## Folders
The folders are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the folder named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some folders will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie.
