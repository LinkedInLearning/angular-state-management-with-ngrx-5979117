## Course Description

Once you've worked with Angular awhile, you discover that the difficult part of architecting apps is making sure data flows and is refreshed in the UI in a consistent way. This process is called state management. In this course, Instructor Alain Chautard teaches the principles of state management in the context of reactive programming, giving you a solid foundation for your Angular architecture. Learn how to react to and trigger state changes, dispatch actions, and work with effects, selectors, and entities. Plus, find out to build a robust component architecture with NgRx, including the recently added signal store. NgRx has quickly become the go-to solution for state management in large Angular applications, and Alain makes sure you know how to use NgRx to provide an Angular-specific implementation of Redux that supports lazy-loaded modules, observables, and asynchronous side effects.

## Instructions
This repository has folders for each of the videos in the course. 

## Folders
The folders are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the folder named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some folders will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie.
